# Basic_C_programming_language



## Description:

This assignment was created to practice the fundamental concepts of the C programming language. It includes basic programs that deal with input/output operations, simple arithmetic calculations, conditional statements like if and if-else, and the overall structure of a C program. By completing this assignment, I have gained practical experience in writing error-free code and understanding how a basic C program works step by step.
## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts Used:

(i) Header files and basic structure of a C program (#include, main())

(ii) Variable declaration and initialization

(iii) Data types (int, float, char, etc.)

(iv) Input and output using scanf() and printf()

(v) Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)

(vi) Conditional statements (if, if-else)

(vii) Comments for code explanation

(viii) Basic logic building
## âœ¨ Features:

* Simple and clean code structure

* User-friendly input and output operations

* Uses standard C syntax and functions

* Demonstrates basic decision-making using if and if-else

* Performs basic arithmetic operations

* Easy to understand and beginner-friendly

* Includes comments for better readability
## ðŸ””Purpose:

* To understand the basic structure of a C program

* To learn how to take input and display output

* To practice variable declaration and data types

* To build basic problem-solving skills using C

* To implement conditional logic using if and if-else

* To improve logical thinking and coding confidence
## ðŸ§  Concepts Practiced:

=> Writing and compiling basic C programs

=> Using variables and data types effectively

=> Taking user input with scanf()

=> Displaying output using printf()

=> Applying arithmetic operations

=> Implementing conditional statements (if, if-else)

=> Understanding program flow control

=> dding comments to improve code readability
## ðŸ“š What I Learned from This:

-> The basic structure and syntax of a C program

-> How to write simple programs that take input and produce output

-> The use of variables and different data types

-> Applying arithmetic and logical operations

-> Implementing decision-making with if and if-else statements

-> How to debug simple errors and write clean code

-> Importance of comments for better code understanding
